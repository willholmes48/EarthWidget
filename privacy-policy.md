## Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: 27 May 2025_

### 1. Introduction  
Earth Widget is published by **Will Holmes** (“we”, “our”, “us”).  
We take privacy seriously and collect **no personal data** beyond what is needed to centre the globe on your location.

### 2. Data we collect  

| Data (optional) | Purpose | Stored | Shared |
|---|---|---|---|
| Approximate latitude & longitude | To shade day/night for your position | Securely in App-Group storage on your device | No-one |

No analytics SDKs, adverts, or third-party trackers are used. The app never connects to our servers.

### 3. Location permission  
On first launch we ask for **“While Using the App”** location access.  
Decline and the widget defaults to London.  
Change this any time in **Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services**.

### 4. Data retention  
The last known coordinate stays only on your device and is deleted automatically if you uninstall the app.

### 5. Your rights (UK GDPR)  
Because we process no server-side personal data, rights such as access, erasure, and portability can be exercised by revoking location permission or deleting the app.

### 6. Children  
Earth Widget is not directed to children under 13 and collects no information that could identify a child.

### 7. Changes  
If we ever add analytics or cloud features, we will update this policy and notify you in-app.
